The first thing is that it is fun to play the game of "You Draw, I Guess" and everyone describes the object. 
The second thing is that it is fun to color together because everyone is working towards the same goal. 
The third thing is that it is fun when I am a developer. Because I feel very involved as the protagonist in this game
The fourth thing is that it is fun to make games together. 
The fifth thing is that when I was preparing pre-class supplies, I bought a protractor instead of a thermometer.
The first boring thing is too little interaction between classmates.
The second boring thing is too many professional concepts.
The third boring thing is that a class is too long.
For me, there is no such thing as boring.
