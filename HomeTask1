The second thing is that it is fun to color together because everyone is working towards the same goal. 
The third thing is that it is fun when I am a developer. Because I feel very involved as the protagonist in this game
The fourth thing is that it is fun to make games together. 
The fifth thing is that when I was preparing pre-class supplies, I bought a protractor instead of a thermometer.
